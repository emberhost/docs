# Anticheats

### Vulcan \[Paid]

Vulcan is a cheat detection plugin that operates at the packet level. It is capable of detecting combat, movement, and even miscellaneous hacks. Vulcan also comes with [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vulcanbungee-bungee-hook-for-vulcan-anti-cheat.94194/) support.

**Setup**

Start by downloading Vulcan on their [Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vulcan-advanced-cheat-detection-1-7-1-17-1.83626/), before uploading the JAR file into your plugins folder and restarting your server. If you want to use this plugin with BungeeCord, check out the instructions on Vulcan's [Bungee Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vulcanbungee-bungee-hook-for-vulcan-anti-cheat.94194/) for details.

### Spartan \[Paid]

Spartan is an anticheat similar to Vulcan. However, it is notorious for having a large performance hit, and is thus generally not recommended over the alternative options on this page. Nevertheless, it has some unique features which may be of use depending on the server.

**Setup**

Start by downloading Spartan on their [Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spartan-advanced-anti-cheat-cheat-detection-hack-blocker-1-7-1-19-1-10-summer-sale.25638/), upload the JAR file into your plugins folder, and restart your server! If you want to use this plugin with bungeecord, then you're in luck: Spartan has BungeeCord functionality built-in.

### GrimAC \[Free]

Grim is a bit different: it's a prediction-based anticheat. This means that it simulates all possible vanilla movements, meaning it's also theoretically 'unbypassable'. However, it should be noted that it does not extensively cover combat detections at time of writing.&#x20;

**Setup**

Download Grim on their [Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/grim-anticheat.99923/), before uploading the JAR file into your plugins folder and restarting your server.&#x20;

### Themis \[Free]

Themis is a well-known lightweight & free anticheat that has been around for quite a while. It's currently one of the best check-based free anticheats around! What makes Themis stand out even more is the fact that it actually checks Bedrock players who have connected through Geyser - instead of simply ignoring them like the other anticheats listed on this page.

**Setup**

Download Themis on their [Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/themis-anti-cheat-1-17-1-18-1-19-bedrock-support-paper-compatibility-free-optimized.90766/), before uploading the JAR file into your plugins folder and restarting your server! Please remember you will need [Protocollib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to run this plugin, and [floodgate](https://ci.opencollab.dev/job/GeyserMC/job/Floodgate/job/dev%2F2.0/) if you want proper Bedrock compatibility.

### Tips

It's best practice to have a test server (even a local one if getting a hosted one isn't an option) to test your anti-cheat configuration before deploying it on your production server. It is important that you are aware of the settings and punishments enabled in your anticheat!

Finally, as with all anticheats, expect false positives. Please obtain as much information as possible to aid with fixing the broken detection, and then report the bug on each respective anticheat's Discord or GitHub.
