# Geyser and Floodgate

### **What Is Geyser?**

Geyser is a plugin that will modify incoming and outgoing packets. It is technically a proxy that will bridge the gap between **Minecraft: Java Edition** and **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**. At the moment, this means it allows Bedrock users to seamlessly join Java servers for cross-platform play!

### **Setup**

Download the plugin [here](https://geysermc.org/download) and set the port in your `config.yml` to a port you have access to/have opened. Note that we also recommend you to use [floodgate](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/setup/) which will be used for authentication. Simply remember to set auth-type in your Geyser `config.yml` to `floodgate` if you choose to do so!

**Anti-Cheats** \
Running Geyser may result in incompatibilities with Anti-Cheats! Make sure to check if your Anti-Cheat has Geyser compatibility - and make any adjustments to its configuration files to support Geyser if needed.
