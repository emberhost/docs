# Updating Servers

### **How To Update Your Server Version**

This process is actually incredibly easy, and the following instructions are for servers running PaperMC.

1. Go to Paper's [website](https://papermc.io).
2. Download the latest build (of the version you want).
3. Rename the file to `server.jar` or whatever you specified your server JAR file name to be in the startup tab of our panel.
4. Replace the current `server.jar` in your server files with the new one you just downloaded.
5. Restart/start your server.

Any new chunks generated should now contain new world generation if applicable, and you're now running the newer Minecrat version you want.



### **How To Downgrade Your Server Version**

This process is technically not possible, and updated worlds cannot be downgraded. The only 'real' way to downgrade is to restore from a backup. However, if you don't need to keep your world files and don't have a backup, follow these steps.&#x20;

1. Stop your server.
2. Change your server JAR file to the version you want.
3. Delete the folders `world`, `world_nether` and `world_the_end.`
4. Restart/start your server.
