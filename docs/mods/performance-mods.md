# Performance Mods

### Introduction <a href="#chunky" id="chunky"></a>

It's undeniable: modded server are simply much slower than servers based on Paper or its forks. Thus, here are some **Fabric** mods that can aid performance! Do note that even with these mods, performance still won't be comparable to a server running on Paper.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Forge Support?**

Most of these mods also have a Forge equivalent, where a developer has ported it to Forge. However, as many of these ports aren't official versions of the mod, they won't be included in this list.

### Mods In Alphabetical Order:

#### Alternate Current <a href="#chunky" id="chunky"></a>

Optimises redstone. The most noticeable impact of this mod should be with redstone dust, where it can be up to 20x faster. Changes to redstone made by this mod are unnoticeable by _most_ players.

#### Lithium[​](https://docs.bloom.host/mods-install/#lithium) <a href="#lithium" id="lithium"></a>

Mod for general-purpose optimisation which should improve several systems without changing any vanilla mechanics.&#x20;

#### Phosphor[​](https://docs.bloom.host/mods-install/#phosphor) <a href="#phosphor" id="phosphor"></a>

Mod which optimises the lighting engine. The most noticable impact of this mod is improved chunk generation speed.&#x20;

> You can either choose to install Phosphor or Starlight. You can't run the two together, as they both attempt to optimise the lighting engine, but each in a different way.

#### ServerCore <a href="#starlight" id="starlight"></a>

Mod that aims to optimise and improve server performance across several areas. Unlike Lithium though, some of the modifications this mod makes may slightly alter vanilla gameplay. However, you can toggle these patches if you don't like them.

#### Starlight[​](https://docs.bloom.host/mods-install/#starlight) <a href="#starlight" id="starlight"></a>

Mod which optimises the lighting engine. The most noticable impact of this mod is improved chunk generation speed. Although Starlight is much faster than Phosphor, it is also likely to have more incompatibilities due to being more invasive - it completely rewrites the lighting engine.

Diagnoses exact reasons of lag on your server whilst also providing server 'health reports'.

**Very Many Players**

VMP is a server-side optimisation mod designed for higher playercounts. It's best used with [Lithium](performance-mods.md#lithium). This mod is technically still in alpha at time of writing, so use it at your own discretion.&#x20;
