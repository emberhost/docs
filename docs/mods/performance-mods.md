# Performance Mods

### Introduction <a href="#chunky" id="chunky"></a>

It's undeniable: modded server are simply much slower than servers based on Paper or its forks. Thus, here are some **Fabric** mods that can aid performance! Do note that even with these mods, performance still won't be comparable to a server running on Paper.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Forge Support?**

Most of these mods also have a Forge equivalent, where a developer has ported it to Forge. However, as many of these ports aren't official versions of the mod, they won't be included in this list.
{% endhint %}

### Mods In Alphabetical Order:

#### Alternate Current <a href="#chunky" id="chunky"></a>

Optimises redstone. The most noticeable impact of this mod should be with redstone dust, where it can be up to 20x faster. Changes to redstone made by this mod are unnoticeable by _most_ players.

#### Chunky[​](https://docs.bloom.host/mods-install/#chunky) <a href="#chunky" id="chunky"></a>

Chunk pre-generation mod. It helps in reducing server lag caused by chunk generation.

#### LazyDFU[​](https://docs.bloom.host/mods-install/#lazydfu) <a href="#lazydfu" id="lazydfu"></a>

#### Lithium[​](https://docs.bloom.host/mods-install/#lithium) <a href="#lithium" id="lithium"></a>

Mod for general-purpose optimisation which should improve several systems without changing any vanilla mechanics.&#x20;

[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium/)

***

#### Moonrise <a href="#starlight" id="starlight"></a>

Mod which is a port of several important [Paper](../server-management/server-optimisation.md#server-software) patches. These include optimizations to the light engine (Starlight), chunk system, entity collisions, entity tracker, and random ticking optimizations. It optimizes many (but not all) of the same parts of the game as Lithium, so any conflicting areas are just disabled to enable compatibility.&#x20;

> The main optimization mod this this is not compatible with is C2ME, as both modify the chunk system. This makes them fundamentally incompatible with one another.

#### ServerCore <a href="#starlight" id="starlight"></a>

Mod that aims to optimise and improve server performance across several areas. Unlike Lithium though, some of the modifications this mod makes may slightly alter vanilla gameplay. However, you can toggle these patches if you don't like them.

#### Spark[​](https://docs.bloom.host/mods-install/#spark) <a href="#spark" id="spark"></a>

Diagnoses exact reasons of lag on your server whilst also providing server 'health reports'.

**Very Many Players**

VMP is a server-side optimisation mod designed for higher playercounts. It's best used with [Lithium](performance-mods.md#lithium). This mod is technically still in alpha at time of writing, so use it at your own discretion.&#x20;
