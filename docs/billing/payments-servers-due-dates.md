# Payments, Servers, Due Dates

{% hint style="info" %}
**How do I actually pay?**

At time of writing, we only accept credit or debit card for invoices. This is a secure, efficient, and easy way for us to process payments!
{% endhint %}

After buying a server, an invoice will be added to your account on the day your server is set to be renewed. You will receive an email reminding you to pay your invoice if payment cannot be automatically collected on the due date. After your invoice is overdue by 1 day, your server will be suspended and your service will be considered expired. Technically speaking, if your server is suspended, it is eligible to be terminated at any time. You will be reminded via email of your service being overdue on day 3 and day 6 after the invoice's due date \[if your server has not yet been terminated]. 7 days after your service has expired, your service will be terminated and all data deleted if not done so already. \
